## Overview

A production-ready machine learning API that provides image classification and object detection capabilities through a simple REST interface.

## Core Capabilities

- Image classification (1000+ categories)
- Object detection with bounding boxes
- Batch processing support
- Real-time inference
- Model versioning

## Technical Stack

- **Framework**: FastAPI
- **ML Library**: TensorFlow 2.x
- **Models**: ResNet50, YOLO v5
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Deployment**: Kubernetes on GCP

## API Design

```python
# Image Classification
POST /api/v1/classify
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

# Object Detection
POST /api/v1/detect
Content-Type: application/json
```

## Performance

- Average inference time: 150ms
- Handles 100 requests/second
- Auto-scaling based on load
- 99.95% uptime

## Model Training

- Custom dataset of 100K images
- Transfer learning from ImageNet
- Accuracy: 94.5%
- Continuous model retraining pipeline

## Deployment

- Docker containers
- Kubernetes orchestration
- Load balancing
- Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana
