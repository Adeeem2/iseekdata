## Project Overview

ENET'Com Docs is a centralized academic resource platform I built to help students at the École Nationale d'Électronique et des Télécommunications de Sfax access course materials effortlessly. The platform serves over 4 engineering programs (GEC, GT, GII, IDSD) and LTIC and provides a modern, student-friendly interface with integrated productivity tools.

What started as a simple idea to organize scattered course materials evolved into a full-featured platform with Google Drive integration, a built-in Pomodoro timer, study music player, and an eye-friendly dark mode with animated galaxy background. The platform is fully responsive and optimized for mobile devices, where most students access their materials.

### Key Technical Achievements

**The Challenge: From Google Drive to Dynamic Web Content**

The main challenge was transforming scattered Google Drive folders into an organized, accessible platform. I solved this through a two-phase approach:

**Phase 1: Python Scraper - Drive to JSON**

I built a Python scraper using the Google Drive API to recursively fetch all course folders and convert them into structured JSON files:

```python
# Fetching and structuring drive data into JSON
def fetch_folder_structure(folder_id, service):
    files = service.files().list(
        q=f"'{folder_id}' in parents",
        fields="files(id, name, mimeType, webViewLink)"
    ).execute()
    return files.get('files', [])
```

Each program (GEC, GT, GII, IDSD, LTIC) got its own JSON file with the complete folder hierarchy, file names, and shareable links. This eliminated the need for real-time API calls on the frontend, drastically improving load times.

**Phase 2: JavaScript Renderer - JSON to Interactive UI**

The frontend dynamically renders these JSON files into an interactive file browser:

```javascript
// Loading and rendering JSON data
fetch('js/GEC_1st_Year.json')
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => renderFileStructure(data));
```

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center', margin: '1.5rem 0' }}>
  <div style={{ maxWidth: '640px', margin: '0 auto', aspectRatio: '640/331', overflow: 'hidden', borderRadius: '8px' }}>
    <img src="/images/enetdocs-darkmode.gif" alt="Dark mode toggle demonstration" style={{ width: '100%', height: '109%', objectFit: 'cover', objectPosition: 'top', display: 'block' }} />
  </div>
</div>

**Additional Features**

- **Dark Mode System**: Built with CSS custom properties and localStorage for persistence across sessions
- **Animated Galaxy Background**: Canvas-based particle system that activates in dark mode for an immersive experience
- **Pomodoro Timer**: Integrated productivity tool with music player to help students during study sessions
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with smooth animations and touch-friendly navigation

### Impact & Results

The platform has become an essential tool for ENET'Com students, serving **100+ course folders** organized across 3 academic years for 5 engineering programs. With **70% mobile traffic** and an average session duration exceeding **8 minutes**, the platform demonstrates strong user engagement. The pre-generated JSON approach achieved **Lighthouse scores of 90+** across all metrics.

### Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Python with Google Drive API v3 for scraping and JSON generation
- **Frontend**: JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3
- **Data Architecture**: JSON-based static file serving for optimal performance
- **Styling**: CSS Custom Properties for theming
- **Deployment**: Vercel

### Key Takeaways

This project demonstrates the power of combining Python for data processing with vanilla JavaScript for frontend rendering. By pre-processing Drive data into JSON files, I achieved fast load times without sacrificing functionality. The platform continues to serve hundreds of students and receives positive feedback for its intuitive design and helpful features.
