## Introduction

In today's digital age, having a strong online presence is crucial for developers and designers. A personal portfolio website serves as your digital business card, showcasing your skills, projects, and personality to potential employers and clients.

In this guide, I'll walk you through building a minimal, performant portfolio website using Next.js 14 and Tailwind CSS.

## Why Next.js?

Next.js has become the go-to framework for modern web applications due to its:

- **Performance**: Built-in optimizations for images, fonts, and code splitting
- **SEO**: Server-side rendering and static generation support
- **Developer Experience**: Fast refresh, TypeScript support, and intuitive routing
- **Flexibility**: Can be deployed anywhere from Vercel to self-hosted servers

## Design Philosophy

When designing a portfolio, less is often more. Here are the key principles I followed:

### 1. Whitespace is Your Friend

Generous spacing makes content more readable and gives your work room to breathe. Don't be afraid of empty space.

### 2. Typography Matters

Choose a clean, modern font. I used Inter for its excellent readability and professional appearance.

### 3. Consistent Layout

Use a grid system and maintain consistent spacing throughout. Square cards create a clean, geometric aesthetic.

### 4. Performance First

Every design decision should consider performance. Use Next.js Image for optimization, implement lazy loading, and minimize JavaScript.

## Technical Implementation

### Setting Up Next.js

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-portfolio --typescript --tailwind --app
```

This command sets up a Next.js project with:
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- App Router for modern routing

### Project Structure

```
my-portfolio/
â”œâ”€â”€ app/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layout.tsx
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ page.tsx
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ about/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ projects/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ contact/
â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Card.tsx
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Nav.tsx
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Footer.tsx
â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ projects/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ posts/
â””â”€â”€ lib/
    â””â”€â”€ mdx.ts
```

### Content Management with MDX

MDX allows you to write content in Markdown with React components. It's perfect for portfolios because:

- Easy to write and maintain
- Supports frontmatter for metadata
- Can include interactive components
- Version control friendly

### Styling with Tailwind

Tailwind CSS enables rapid development with utility classes:

```tsx
<div className="max-w-content mx-auto px-6 py-12">
  <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mb-4">
    Welcome
  </h1>
</div>
```

## Deployment

### Vercel (Recommended)

Vercel offers the best Next.js deployment experience:

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Import project in Vercel
3. Deploy with one click

### Other Options

- **Netlify**: Great alternative with similar simplicity
- **AWS**: More control, requires more configuration
- **Self-hosted**: Full control but more maintenance

## Performance Optimization

### Image Optimization

Use Next.js Image component:

```tsx
import Image from 'next/image';

<Image
  src="/profile.jpg"
  alt="Profile"
  width={400}
  height={400}
  priority
/>
```

### Static Generation

Pre-render pages at build time:

```tsx
export async function generateStaticParams() {
  const projects = await getProjects();
  return projects.map(project => ({
    slug: project.slug
  }));
}
```

### Code Splitting

Next.js automatically splits code by route, but you can also use dynamic imports:

```tsx
const Component = dynamic(() => import('./Component'));
```

## SEO Best Practices

### Metadata

```tsx
export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: 'Your Name - Developer',
  description: 'Personal portfolio...',
  openGraph: {
    title: 'Your Name',
    description: '...',
    images: ['/og-image.png']
  }
};
```

### Semantic HTML

Use proper HTML elements for better accessibility and SEO:

```tsx
<article>
  <h1>Title</h1>
  <time>Date</time>
  <p>Content</p>
</article>
```

## Accessibility

Make your portfolio accessible to everyone:

- Use semantic HTML
- Include alt text for images
- Ensure keyboard navigation works
- Maintain sufficient color contrast
- Test with screen readers

## Conclusion

Building a portfolio doesn't have to be complicated. With Next.js and Tailwind CSS, you can create a fast, beautiful, and maintainable portfolio that showcases your work effectively.

The key is to focus on simplicity, performance, and content. Let your work speak for itself.
